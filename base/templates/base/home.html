					<h5>How I Learn</h5>

					<p>Find a tutorial to learn the basics then dive in head first into a real world project, plug and play and reverse engineering. I value documentations and most of my machine learning knowledge is from scikit learn docs.</p>

					<p>I always pay utmost attention to detail while I learn. I make sure even if I know 20%, no one can challenge me on that 20%.</p>

					<h5>My Short Term Goals</h5>

				<p>Finish Collection frameworks in Java and start attempting Leetcode questions in Java. Although I am proficient in python I want to be a dual wielder. And one day I shall learn C++ too. </p>
